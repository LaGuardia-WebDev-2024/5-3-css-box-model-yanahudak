## Directions 
### Step #1 - Add borders <br>
This webpage displays a gallery of photos of boxer dogs. In this first step, add a border to all of the photos. Try and make it look like a photo frame, if you can.  <br><br>
In case you need a reminder - [CSS Border Information](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border_shorthand.asp)
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Add margin <br>
The photos look a bit too close to each other. Add margin to them, either on all sides or just the sides that matter to separate them.
<br><br>
### Step #3 - Add padding <br>
The photos are too close to the side of the gallery div, and it looks weird. Add padding around all sides of the gallery div so that it looks better.
